HOW TO KNOW WHICH CARD TO DRAFT ?
BECAUSE MY STRATEGY IS AN AGGRESSIVE ONE, I HAVE TO CHOOSE THE CARDS THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY
GIVE ME THE HIGHEST POTENTIAL DAMAGE OUTPUT

	CALCULATE POTENTIAL DAMAGE OUTPUT:
	----------------------------------

Direct damage at summon = BEST, because there is 100% chance those will be dealt.

Charge creatures have a better pdmgo than normal creatures
only if this damage can be dealt directly (no opponent guard creatures left at summon) 

Ward creatures have a better pdmgo than normal creatures
because they can not be traded with only one ennemy creature.

	I NEED CARDS TO GET RID OF GUARD CREATURES.
	-------------------------------------------

Lethal creatures one shot any opponent guard creature it can deal damage to.

Breakthrough creatures can trade into guard creatures if their attack is sufficient
but also provide additional pdmgo

PDMGO RANKING OF ABILITIES:
---------------------------

1. DDaS 
2. Charge 
3. Ward
4. Breakthrough

GUARD DESTROYER RANKING OF ABILITIES:
-------------------------------------

2. Lethal
3. High atk + Breakthrough
